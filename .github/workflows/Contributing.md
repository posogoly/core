#Contributing to Pososlogy

As an open source project, Django welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

Extensive contribution guidelines are available in the repository at
``coming/soon/``, or online at:

https://docs.posology.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/comingsoo

**Warning: non-trivial pull requests (anything more than fixing a typo) without
Trac tickets will be closed!** `Please file a ticket`__ to suggest changes.

//TODO Posology needs to choose a system to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
patches because GitHub doesn't provide adequate tooling for its community.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't file a ticket,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution.
